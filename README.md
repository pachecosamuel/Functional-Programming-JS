# Functional-Programming-JS
## Samuel Pacheco 

Since the emergence of the procedural paradigm, functions are protagonists in software development. Due to its importance and excellence in the development process, functions today have a programming paradigm all thought around themselves, functional programming.

In this course we will use one of the most popular languages ​​in the world, Javascript. Although developed in Javascript, the concepts presented during the course can be applied in any object-oriented or multi-paradigm languages.

We will cover some of the main concepts of functional programming and we will also talk extensively about function concepts and their practical applications. We'll talk, for example, about High-Order Functions, First-Class Functions. We will cover very important methods in functional programming such as Map, Filter and Reduce. We will cover from environment configuration to object orientation, through function anatomy, callback functions and asynchronous programming with promises and async/await.
